PERSONAL

Ray Tracer
A scene with 14 triangles and MT with a resolution of 512x512 runs at 130 fps. Meshes were supported but my BVH implementation isn't working yet.

Empires
Empires is a game made for the Raspberry PI. It introduced me to graphics programming. It uses OpenGLES 2.0 and is written in C++. The game is a colonization game where you have to colonize the whole galaxy. Each playthrough is randomly generated. In the end, the game runs as a simulation

Ray Shaper

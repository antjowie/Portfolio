## Introduction
This repo contains my portfolio. It is hosted using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). You can visit it [here](https://angelorettob.com/).

<!-- ## Dependencies
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). The web server that I'm using. It supplies me with a domain and makes sure that my portfolio stays online. I use this over [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) out of pure curiosity and because of the [additional features](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/) that it has though I won't be using them anytime soon.

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This program generates a static site for me. I use it over [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because Hugo said that it was faster. I didn't see a reason to use a slower software. 

- [Hermit](https://github.com/Track3/hermit). This is the theme that I am using. I don't have much experience with web development, so I've used this theme as a base because it looks very minimal. I don't need any decoration as I will be doing that myself.

- [Google Analytics](https://google.com/analytics). The theme supported this, it is so I can track the traffic on my site although I probably will forget about it. Knowing these things is nice though and it may serve helpfull in the future.

- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). The theme supported this. Disqus is a chat platform. I've added it to the site so that people can easily give write down their thoughts on a post if they feel like it.  -->

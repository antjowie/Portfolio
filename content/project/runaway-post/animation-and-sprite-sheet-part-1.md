Tools make us productive if you choose the right one for the job. When it comes to sprite sheets, there are a whole bunch of choices. I too have got my little bag of drawing tools which we will discuss below.

Because I&#8217;m fairly new to game developing, I still program 2D games. Not that it is a bad thing, but I haven&#8217;t even once touched 3D animations. This post is about [Runaway][1] so let us discuss the tools that I&#8217;ve used to make this sprite sheet.

Artistic opinions aside, this is the sprite sheet of the player in [Runaway][1]. As you can see, all the rows represent the movement and the columns represent the animation. This may be handled differently by your animation handler, so please research that first before making your sprite sheet.

The software used to make this sprite sheet is called [Piskel][2]. Piskel is a great, free tool which is used for 2D pixel art and animation.

I will not discuss how to use Piskel or any other software because that is not what this post is about.

At this moment this is actually the only tool I use. I&#8217;ve used Photoshop before which also works well but I prefer the simple program Piskel. Piskel is also web-based, no installation required! When I do use Photoshop, I tend to use it for my tiles.

Animations are an important part of a game, so knowing your way with different animation software is always a good thing (expanding your knowledge is generally a good thing). That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m planning to use some other tools for animation in the future. I&#8217;ve looked at programs like Autodesk Maya but that&#8217;s more in the 3D direction. 2D games are way simpler so you don&#8217;t need some advanced software like Photoshop in my opinion.

That all said, u should use whichever software you want to use. If you are interested in how I implemented my animation handler, you can look at the next part by clicking on [this][3].

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day.

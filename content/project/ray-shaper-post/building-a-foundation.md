After having brainstormed for a while, I decided to make a puzzle game based on the reflection of lasers. It is not the most creative game but I am interested in programming it. I will call the game Ray Shaper because you shape the ray using objects and your own glass shield. The objective is to get the ray to the door. Sounds pretty easy, right?

After having made my first game, there are many things I have learned. One of the most useful things that I have learned is to first make your art. It&#8217;s not handy when you are in a programming mood and can&#8217;t test your code because you don&#8217;t have the right textures, you could, of course, use a temporary texture, but I just find it way handier when the actual thing is there.

It&#8217;s a simple tileset but graphics are not relevant to the assignment. I actually quite like the look of it. The movement of the sprite has been inspired by <a href="https://mnrart.deviantart.com/art/prototype-Battle-Pals-398823616" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this game</a>. Now I only need a few sounds. I will have a sound for:

  * <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/216634/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when the laser hits a glass tile,</a>
  * <a href="https://freesound.org/people/tec%20studios/sounds/351905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when the level section is completed,</a>
  * <a href="http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/?s=eNpjYBL4Nt2QgcXaiAEM6hvA1DxGFqaX9f_t_zMYG0EEfc6g0pEzsIurpUENYV8H1DoRyAAaAhaB0UQIMKDyYWbC7Kz_D4Ly_4F8ABR-MR8." target="_blank" rel="noopener">when the user clicks a button,</a>
  * <a href="https://freesound.org/people/plasterbrain/sounds/243020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when the user starts the game,</a>
  * <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Audiobinger/~/Video_Game_Music_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main menu music and</a>
  * <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Questiion/sounds/177089/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">background music</a>

Neat! The sound and art are finished in but one day! onto the next phase, the basic game foundations.

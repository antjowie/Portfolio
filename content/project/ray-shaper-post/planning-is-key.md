Reflection is an interesting theme because I have never done anything with it. When I think about it, the first thing that comes to mind is light. Because ideas go away so fast I always write them down in a word web/mind map or some other kind of structure. This gives me an ordered overview of all my ideas and by doing that I can mix them together to make something interesting.

I decided to go with a puzzle game. Puzzle games are quite easy to program if I&#8217;m being honest. The hardest part is the level design. I&#8217;m not sure if level design plays a key part in the programming variation (because level design is more a thing for the design & production variation) but the mechanics of the puzzles are a key part in the programming variation. So I made sure to make a game that really depends on the game mechanics.

I also need to make some sort of schedule because time is limited so I can&#8217;t slack off midway or lose track of my progress. By viewing my idea, I can make a basic table in which the core sections of my games are noted with expected time duration right next to them.

  * Art and sound 2 days 
      * Art 1 days
      * Sound 1 day
  * Basic game foundation 6 days 
      * Game state manager half a day
      * Main menu half a day
      * Level select menu 2 days
      * Level menu 2 days
      * Options menu 1 day
  * Level mechanics 8 days 
      * Light reflection mechanics 2 days
      * Player mechanics 1 days
      * Light ray mechanics 3 days
      * Object mechanics 2 days
  * Levels 1 day 
      * Making a few levels 1 day

A total of 17 days. Those are my guidelines. If I keep up to date with them, the game should finish in time. It&#8217;s gonna be quite the challenge! But that is something you are expected to be able to handle.

Let&#8217;s do this!

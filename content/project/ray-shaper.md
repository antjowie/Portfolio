When I was 13 I first heard about NHTV. I was in second grade and already started looking for a school to enter. Back then I was quite scared of the future. I realized the importance of the decisions we have to make right now and was afraid that I would choose something that wouldn&#8217;t satisfy me. I don&#8217;t feel that way anymore. I make sure that every decision that I make right now regarding my future will be the correct one. If I always try my hardest there is no way I could regret my chooses. By doing that I should always end where I was meant to be.

Right now, I think that place is at NHTV. I take programming quite seriously. I do not see programming as just a hobby, I see it as a way to live. Kinda like how an artist lives his live drawing, I want to live my life creating worlds in programs. When I visited NHTV on their open day, I instantly felt it click. I could already feel myself at home. I especially liked talking to other people about programming, something I should be doing way more. My motivation to program only grew.

And here I am, applying for the school. It&#8217;s finally time. I will update my progress on this page when I find something discuss-worthy. So let&#8217;s get started.

> Unforuntaly I didn't update this project a lot during the development of it. Most of the notes have been made in my notebook because I was running out of time. The things that I could recover are recovered though.  
> The game can be downloaded from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HnHZUPI-AYm1g8gb9E_X2jkpqDRxm6OK). The project is hosted on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/antjowie/Ray-Shaper).

[The theme of the game][1]. You should always plan your projects. It will make sure you are organized and helps you keep track of your progress. So let&#8217;s make one.
  
[The art and sound of the game][2]. Every game needs them, right?

[Building the game loop.][3]

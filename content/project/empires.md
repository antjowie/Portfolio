This game is about colonizing the empire. It is more of a simulation game where you can see your empire grow over time. [**Click here to see the features of the game**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UP6wHF0erPQoFHxp3CygP1c4PjzUsd1M3I1RBvUso-w). The purpose of this project was to be introduced to working on different platforms than your computer (In our case, the Raspberry Pi). Thus, it is important that the code you write is optimized, you can't rely on the power of the computer.

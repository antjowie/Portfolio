Hello reader. I am Angelo, a young developer with a particular interest in games. Since 2016, I've compiled my first program in C++ and right now I am studying at [BUas](https://www.buas.nl/en) to get my bachelor. I continue to explore what this medium has to offer. If you are interested in what I have made, I suggest you have a look at my [project page]({{< ref "project/" >}}).

I mainly program in C++ but I'm very flexible with what tools I'm using and always research what tools are best for the job. I have experience with many different sections in game dev. 

I'm dedicated to this craft. I have been programming since 2016. I'm a student that follows a course on game development. I do a bunch of side projects (making my own framework for games, making mods for other games) and sometimes play around in other sections (such as web development). I'm someone who doesn't fumble with his fingers during a project. I always put in my best effort because I want to make full use the opportunities that I get. I want to craft experiences that influence people the way games influenced me.  

> You can see my projects [here]({{< ref "/project" >}}). If you want to know more about my experiences and who I am, read further.

# Who am I?
At the moment I'm studying at [BUas](https://www.buas.nl/en). I'm following a full-time course called [Creative Media and Game Technologies](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies) which is a bachelor. My discipline is a programmer, I have no specification yet because I enjoy all sides of it, but will probably aim to become an engine/tools programmer.  
I have been playing games from a young age, I actually can't remember what I did before that. Games are a huge part of my life. I want others to also experience the joy that I get from them.  

There is more to my life than gaming though. I enjoy shopping and cooking. I also enjoy sports. I'm trying to pick up some instruments and enjoy building things and I love technology.  

I enjoy being a part of this community. I will do my best to make great games so that people can experience the joy that I get from them.

# My experiences with programming
I have fumbled around with many programming languages:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/),
- [Go](https://golang.org/), 
- [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), 
- [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)),
- and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).

But if I'm being honest, the only thing that they differ in is syntax and intention. It is just like a tool, the way to handle it is different and the usage of the tool is, but it can do the job. Because of this, I am not really learning languages for the sake of it, I instead learn languages based on what it is intended for and why people use them. For example, I was writing a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot and wanted to write it in Go. While this worked out, I later decided to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) because it has more libraries and an easier syntax (IMO). This resulted in me being able to write the same bot but with fewer lines of code and I could do it faster. It may perform worse, but development was more rapid and performance wasn't a bottleneck.   
What I'm trying to say is that I am always ready to learn new languages, because your toolbox can never contain too many tools. 

## My experiences with game development
There are quite a few experiences that I have with game development, I haven't really specialized myself yet and am still orienting my preferences. Here is a list of what I have worked with:

- Graphics (OpenGL specifically, [I've made a ray tracer](1))
- Framework (I've used frameworks and [tried to make my own from scratch](2))
- Cross development (I've made a [game for the Raspberry Pi](3))
- Engines (I've [worked with Unreal Engine](4) and Unity)
- Team development (I've [worked on projects in teams](4))

The links send you to projects that are about the subject. I'm enjoying every aspect of game development. But I think that I prefer gameplay. That is because I enjoy making games and as a gameplay developer, I feel like I have the most influence that I can have over the game. It also feels like the most active role to communicate with everyone in the team and I enjoy talking about games.  
There isn't much more to talk about my experiences about game development because I go way more in-depth about that in the project posts themselves. I'd recommend you to take a look at the [projects]({{< ref "/project" >}}) if you are interested.

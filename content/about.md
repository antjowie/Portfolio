Hello reader, I am Angelo. A young developer with a particular interest in games. I mainly program in C++ but I'm very flexible with what tools I'm using and always  research what tools are best for the job. I have experience with many different sections in game dev. 

I'm dedicated to this craft. I have been programming since 2016. I'm a student that follows a course on game development. I also do side projects (making my own framework for games, making mods for other games) and do a bit of web development. I'm someone who doesn't fumble with his fingers during a project, I'm not capable of that. I always put in my best efforts because I want to make full use of all the oppertunities that I get. I want to craft experiences that influence people the way games have helped me.  

> You can see my projects [here]({{< ref "/project" >}}). If you want to know more about my experiences and who I am, read further.

## Who am I?
At the moment I'm studying at [BUAS](https://www.buas.nl/en). I'm following a full time course called [Creative Media and Game Technologies](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies) which is a bachelors. My dicipline is a programmer, I have no specification yet because I enjoy all sides of it, but will probably aim to become a gameplay programmer. I'm in my second year.  
I have been playing games from young age, I actually can't remember what I did before that. Games are a huge part of my life. I want others to also experience the joy that I get from them.  
There is more to my life than gaming though. I enjoy shoping and cooking. I also enjoy sports. I'm trying to pick up some instruments and enjoy building things. Finally, I ofcourse love technology.  

**Have yet to write the rest...**

## My experiences with programming

## My experiences with game development
I have experience with [Graphics (see my raytracer)](1)Z

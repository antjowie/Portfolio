Hello reader, I am Angelo. A young developer with a particular interest in games. I mainly program in C++ but I'm very flexible with what tools I'm using and always  research what tools are best for the job. I have experience with many different sections in game dev. 

I'm dedicated to this craft. I have been programming since 2016. I'm a student that follows a course on game development. I also do side projects (making my own framework for games, making mods for other games) and do a bit of web development. I'm someone who doesn't fumble with his fingers during a project, I'm not capable of that. I always put in my best efforts because I want to make full use of all the oppertunities that I get. I want to craft experiences that influence people the way games have helped me.  

> You can see my projects [here]({{< ref "/project" >}}). If you want to know more about my experiences and who I am, read further.

# Who am I?
At the moment I'm studying at [BUAS](https://www.buas.nl/en). I'm following a full time course called [Creative Media and Game Technologies](https://www.buas.nl/en/programmes/creative-media-and-game-technologies) which is a bachelors. My dicipline is a programmer, I have no specification yet because I enjoy all sides of it, but will probably aim to become a gameplay programmer. I'm in my second year.  
I have been playing games from young age, I actually can't remember what I did before that. Games are a huge part of my life. I want others to also experience the joy that I get from them.  

There is more to my life than gaming though. I enjoy shoping and cooking. I also enjoy sports. I'm trying to pick up some instruments and enjoy building things. Finally, I ofcourse love technology.  
So to sum it all up. I love technology and I enjoy being a part of this community. I will do my best to make great games so that people can experience the joy that I get from them.

# My experiences with programming
I have fumbled around with many programming languages:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/),
- [Go](https://golang.org/), 
- [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), 
- [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)),
- and [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).

But if I'm being honest, the only thing that they differ in is syntax and intention. It is just like a tool, the way to handle it is different and the usage of the tool is, but it can do the job. Becuase of this, I am not really learning languages for the sake of it, I instead learn languages based on what it is intended for and why people use them. For example, I was writing a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot and wanted to write it in Go. While this worked out, I later decided to use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) because it has more libraries and an easier syntax (imo). This resulted in me being able to write the same bot but with less lines of code and I could do it faster. It may be less performent, but development was more rapid and performence wasn't a bottleneck.   
What I'm trying to say is that I am always ready to learn new languages, because your toolbox can never contain too many tools. 

## My experiences with game development
There are quite a few experiences that I have with game development, I haven't really specialized myself yet and am still orienting my preferences. Here is a list of what I have worked with:

- Graphics (OpenGL specifically, [I've made a ray tracer](1))
- Framework (I've used frameworks and [made my own from scratch](2))
- Cross development (I've made a [game for the Raspberry Pi](3))
- Engines (I've [worked with Unreal Engine](4) and Unity)
- Team development (I've [worked on projects in teams](4))

The links send you to projects that are about the subject. I'm enjoying every aspect of game development. But I think that I prefer gameplay. That is because I enjoy making games and as a gameplay developer, I feel like I have the most influence that I can have over the game. It also feels like the most active role to communicate with everyone in the team and I enjoy talking about games.  
There isn't much more to talk about my experiences about game development because I go way more indept about that in the project posts themselves. I'd reccomend you to take a look at the [projects]({{< ref "/project" >}}) if you are interested.

I've met many people who don't know what to do with their lives. It is a hard question at such a young age: What do you want to become when you get older? You're just starting to get more independent and you already have to make a decision that will shape your future.

> Hello reader, quick note for you. This post is divided into two pieces. The first part is my motivation and how I heard about NHTV, [the second part](#you-have-discovered-nhtv) is my journey through the intake process of NHTV

## What will you do when you get older?
Unlike many people, who didn't know what to do. I already knew where I wanted to invest my live in. The world of technology. I want to join the many people who have made unbelievable things using technology. I want to speek the same language as they do. 

That has been my goal for as long as I can remember. I don't know what I did before that. It probably doesn't come as a suprise, but my first realization of this passion came from gaming. I was playing Ratchet and Clank on the PlayStation 2. The whole fact that there was a world in which I was playing through a computer was facinating. That experience is something that I also want to create.

Because of that goal I always looked forward to classes. It's not such a surprise that my maths, science and english are my greatest subjects. I was always eager to learn. For some reason though, I never really could get the hang of programming. I would look at these youtube videos but would end up copying and pasting code from places. That was not how I wanted to program. I want to know how everything behind it works.

> The reason why programming never wrapped around my head is because it is such a vast subject. I tried to learn programming through modding the game Minecraft. But that clashes with my goal to understand everything behind the scenes. So the real skill that I had to learn was the skill to learn. The skill to know how you should learn something. How you should approach a vast subject and make it digestable. Reading and researching is something that I now do everyday.

## My doubts about programming college
Unfortunately, not many people shared the same thoughts as me about game programming. Some people even told me to get a real job. I started looking around and many people on forums stated that game programmers are lazy and just want to spend their school lives gaming away.  
After looking into it I kinda understood why they said that. It's not that they are lazy or anything, but many schools that started teaching game programming do not really teach you game programming. They teach you how to use the tools game programmers have made. They teach you things like [Unity](https://unity3d.com).

I don't want that. I want to **make** software like Unity. So that's why I started searching and searching and reading...  
But one night, something special happened, something that changed my whole high school live. 

## The goal Destiny gave me
It was during a time that I had bought the PlayStation 4. I never really played on the PlayStation 3. I was more busy playing on my computer. But when I came over to a friend, we would play FIFA. He would beat me because I only played it when I came over but it was fun. That's why I decided to buy a PlayStation 4 together with my dad.  
The PS4 came with a certain deal. Because it was quite expansive, I have made the worst decision in my life. We sold our Gamecube with all our games for 100 euros. (I still miss Mario Sunshine). We were allowed to choose two games. We chose FIFA and Destiny.

I played FIFA and enjoyed it while it lasted. After I had won division one on ultimate team I was done with the game, and started playing Destiny, my addiction for the next few years.

> I'm not gonna talk about Destiny here, but I will say one thing. I absolutely loved Destiny's gameplay, especially the end game activities. I't really pains me too see the game go downhill so badly. I gave it so many chances, I even pre-ordered the Destiny 2 package. I really wanted it to become a great thing, but the content just became to dry. I just couldn't support the developers that released such a package. Hopefully someone will make a game with all the great of Destiny. And if that doesn't happen in the next few years, maybe I'll try something out. 

It wasn't only my addicition, it also became my dads addiction. We almost bought a second PS4 because of it, but my mother didn't like that idea. So I resisted.  
But one night my dad was playing with a few randoms. Also parents by the way. And one of them started talking about their son on how they got into this school with some slim chances to get in. During that time I was considering if a programming school really is worth it, what is it that they teach me that I can't learn online?  
My dad told me about the story, I started to read about it, we decided to go to an open day... And I knew that this was the school that I was searching for.

## You have discovered NHTV
I tried to prepare some questions for the students at NHTV, but didn't really know what to ask because I didn't know much about programming (I was in the first year of high school).
